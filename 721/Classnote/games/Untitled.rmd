```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(gapminder)
library(gifski)  # make sure it's attached so the renderer is available

# 1) Rebuild the animated object (should have class "gganim")
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}", x = "GDP per Capita (log)", y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_minimal()

animated_plot <- p + transition_time(year) + ease_aes("linear")

# sanity check
class(animated_plot)
# expect: "gganim"

# 2) Render explicitly with a renderer (creates an "animation" object)
anim <- animate(
  animated_plot,
  renderer = gifski_renderer(loop = TRUE),
  fps = 20, width = 700, height = 500
)

# 3) Save using the rendered object
anim_save("gapminder_animation.gif", animation = anim)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
